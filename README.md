## Installation
**RhythmPy has been tested to work with python versions 3.7 or lower.**  
<sup>In theory this project should work on Mac / Linux but i have not tested it yet</sup>       

**Method 1: Using the official release installers**           
* <a href="https://github.com/assassinsorrow/RhythmPy/releases">Download the latest release</a> it is faster and includes a installer for RhythmPy with an optional standalone executable                         
                           
**Method 2: Using python**        
1. Clone the Repo `git clone https://github.com/assassinsorrow/RhythmPy.git`
2. CD into the project folder `cd RhythmPy` <sup>The folder that has README.md in it</sup>
3. Install <a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry">Poetry</a>      
  Windows Powershell: `(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -`      
  Linux/Mac: `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python`     
  <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/"><sup>Poetry's documentation<sup></sup></sup></a>
4. Create a virtual environment for RhythmPy with <a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry">Poetry</a> `poetry install --no-dev`
5. CD into working directory `cd RhythmPy` <sup>The folder that has the scripts</sup>
6. Start RhythmPy `poetry run python __main__.py`

**Method 3: The Development Builds**       
*the Development builds will contain bugs and features that may not work, it is for testing and may not be a stable.*     
*it contains two seperate builds that do not include system installers and are not compressed (hence the large file size)*             
***You have been warned!***        
* You can get a development build by downloading the file listed under `Artifacts` <a href="https://github.com/assassinsorrow/RhythmPy/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild">Here</a>    (pick the topmost successful build).        
* You must be logged into GitHub to download a development build.

## Building from source

1. [Follow installation guide to step 3](#installation)
2. install Dev version of RhythmPy `poetry install`    

 **Method 1 Using premade script:**         
 * 3·éê Run `poetry run python Build.py` and follow in terminal instructions   
  
**Method 2: Using pyinstaller**    
 * 3.1 ***OPTIONAL*** Create your own .spec file `poetry run pyi-makespec RhythmPy/__main__.py` and Fill in needed information    <a         href="https://github.com/assassinsorrow/RhythmPy/blob/master/RhythmPy/RhythmPy.spec">click here for example</a>.  
 * 3.2 Run `poetry run pyinstaller --onedir RhythmPy/RhythmPy.spec RhythmPy/__main__.py` to create the .exe  
 you will need to define where the ui elements can be found
     
4. Open the executable found in `dist/RhythmPy` to run the program         

**After building is done there should be two folders `build` and `dist` if they do not appear or if the generated executable does not work please install <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads">Visual C++ Redistributable</a>      
if that does not work recompile with `--debug=all` as an option and then check the logs in `build/Main`**                  
**if you want to create a installer use nsis, i am not going to cover how to do it here due to it being rather simple**
