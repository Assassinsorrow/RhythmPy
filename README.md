## Installation
**RhythmPy has been tested to work with python versions 3.7 or lower.**  
<sup>In theory this project should work on Mac / Linux but i have not tested it yet</sup>       

**Method 1: Using the official release installers**           
* <a href="https://github.com/assassinsorrow/RhythmPy/releases">Download the latest release</a> it is faster and includes a installer for RhythmPy with an optional standalone executable                         
                           
**Method 2: Running / Building the source**     
This project is made using `make` if you are on windows you will need to install `make` before proceeding.
  * Use `make python` to run the python version
  * Use `make build && make run` to build and run

## Building from source

1. [Follow installation guide to step 3](#installation)
2. install Dev version of RhythmPy `poetry install`    

 **Method 1 Using premade script:**         
 * 3·éê Run `poetry run python Build.py` and follow in terminal instructions   
  
**Method 2: Using pyinstaller**    
 * 3.1 ***OPTIONAL*** Create your own .spec file `poetry run pyi-makespec RhythmPy/__main__.py` and Fill in needed information    <a         href="https://github.com/assassinsorrow/RhythmPy/blob/master/RhythmPy/RhythmPy.spec">click here for example</a>.
<sup>you will need to define where the ui elements can be found</sup>
 * 3.2 Run `poetry run pyinstaller --onedir RhythmPy/RhythmPy.spec RhythmPy/__main__.py` to create the .exe  
     
4. Open the executable found in `dist/RhythmPy` to run the program         

**After building is done there should be two folders `build` and `dist` if they do not appear or if the generated executable does not work please install <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads">Visual C++ Redistributable</a>      
if that does not work recompile with `--debug=all` as an option and then check the logs in `build/Main`**                  
**if you want to create a installer use nsis, i am not going to cover how to do it here due to it being rather simple**
